# HIVSimulation
Cellular Automata of HIV Virus Growth within a Host Body for Variations in Antiretroviral Therapy.
This repository consits of the MATLAB code that I used to conduct my research titled "Exploring the Relationship between Adherence to Treatment and Viral Load through a New Discrete Simulation Model of HIV Infectivity".
The research is published in the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) SIGSIM PADS 2015.
